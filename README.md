# FinalProject
data cleaning project for programming course

This is a data cleaning and merging process of three waves (waves 5, 6, and 7) of afrobarometer survey data for subsequent data analysis


## Cleaning scripts

- "wave 5 cleaning.R" is the R script for scraping and cleaning wave 5 of the afrobarometer survey
- "wave 6 cleaning.R" is the R script for scraping and cleaning wave 6 of the afrobarometer survey
- "wave 7 cleaning.R" is the R script for scraping and cleaning wave 5 of the afrobarometer survey

## cleaned data
- "wave5_cleaned.csv" is the output file after cleaning wave 5, i.e. after running "wave 5 cleaning.R"
- "wave6_cleaned.csv" is the output file after cleaning wave 6, i.e. after running "wave 6 cleaning.R"
- "wave7_cleaned.csv" is the output file after cleaning wave 7, i.e. after running "wave 7 cleaning.R"
